\ee Using fv:abal is no more than a
statement of opinion. A strong
statement of aversion, but just an
opinion nonetheless. Since being
disgusted with something does not
necessarily mean it is unfit for purpose,
something being fv:abal does not
necessarily mean it is also fv:slim
(although the two often go hand in
hand). Similarly, fv:abal is different
from fv:tlebe in that the latter implies
an objectively bad quality. If you call
something fv:tlebe, you will be
expected to be able to justify that
statement. If you call something fv:abal
instead, the worst you can expect is
someone asking you why you have
such an opinion.

meanings, all having to do with some
object being changed from an active
state to a state of rest. Its original
meaning is 'to put out', as in 'to put a
fire out'. Related to it is the meaning 'to
switch off', used for electrical
appliances, engines (and thus anything
that contains an engine), but also
computer programs. Finally, it means
'to close', when the object is some kind
of event or speech.

\ee This verb has a wide range of
meanings, all having to do with some
object being changed from a state of
rest to an active state. Its original
meaning is 'to light', as in 'to light a fire,
a candle'. Related to it is the meaning
'to switch on', used for electrical
appliances, engines (and thus anything
that contains an engine), but also
computer programs. Finally, it means
'to open', when the object is some kind
of event or speech.

happens towards the speaker, i.e. from
the listener to the speaker, or from a
third-party to the listener or the
speaker. It is used for transfers
between third-parties, or for transfers
involving inanimate sources and/or
destinations, when the speaker feels
that the transfer is somehow
advantageous for them.

\ee Using fv:kemi is no more than a
statement of opinion. A strong
statement of fondness, but just an
opinion nonetheless. Since being fond
of something does not necessarily
mean it is fit for purpose, something
being fv:kemi does not necessarily
mean it is also fv:vo|sa (although the
two often go hand in hand). Similarly,
fv:kemi is different from fv:ufan in that
the latter implies an objectively great
quality. If you call something fv:ufan,
you will be expected to be able to
justify that statement. If you call
something fv:kemi instead, the worst
you can expect is someone asking you
why you have such an opinion.

fv:jaki: 'to exist', this verb is used to
assert the coming into being of
fv:sponda, i.e. small animals, as well as
inanimate objects or concepts, as well
as the happening of events. It is also
one of the many verbs meaning 'to
become' (but restricted to small
animals and inanimates). In that sense,
the result of the change (the equivalent
of the predicate of 'to become') can be
included by putting it in the final (when
becoming something or someone) or
the instrumental (when the predicate of
'to become' would be an adjective in
English).

happens away from the speaker, i.e.
from the speaker to the listener, or
from the speaker or the listener to a
third-party. It is used for transfers
between third-parties, or for transfers
involving inanimate sources and/or

that the transfer is somehow
disadvantageous or at best neutral for
them.

\oe Basically the inceptive equivalent of
fv:ispej: 'to exist', this verb is used to
assert the coming into being of human
beings, as well as fv:kit, i.e. large
animals. It is also one of the many
verbs meaning 'to become' (but
restricted to humans and big animals).
In that sense, the result of the change
(the equivalent of the predicate of 'to
become') can be included by putting it
in the final (when becoming something
or someone) or the instrumental (when
the predicate of 'to become' would be
an adjective in English).

\oe This verb is used mostly to indicate
non-romantic attraction to people
(basically 'to like as a friend') or
animals. It can also be used with an
inanimate subject (an object, concept
or activity, including a subordinate
clause), but then it is very strong, with
connotations of 'to be fond of (doing)
sthg'.
\ue
\ee This verb refers to the mental activity
usually referred to as 'liking' in English.
However, it does so with a different
argument orientation: the subject of the
verb is the thing or person liked, while
the object is the person doing the liking.

\oe Refers to water that is lukewarm to the

enough to call it fv:zuba.
\ue Unlike fv:vone, fv:zuba or fv:den,
fv:zubzin is not seen as a basic term to
refer to water. Rather, it is seen as a
kind of warm fv:vone or cold fv:zuba,
and can be called as such.
