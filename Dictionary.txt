\ee Using fv:abal is no more than a
statement of opinion. A strong
statement of aversion, but just an
opinion nonetheless. Since being
disgusted with something does not
necessarily mean it is unfit for purpose,
something being fv:abal does not
necessarily mean it is also fv:slim
(although the two often go hand in
hand). Similarly, fv:abal is different
from fv:tlebe in that the latter implies
an objectively bad quality. If you call
something fv:tlebe, you will be
expected to be able to justify that
statement. If you call something fv:abal
instead, the worst you can expect is
someone asking you why you have
such an opinion.

that the transfer is somehow
advantageous for them.

'to give', 'to receive', 'to take', 'to put'

\ue
\ee This verb implies that the transfer
happens away from the speaker, i.e.
from the speaker to the listener, or
from the speaker or the listener to a
third-party. It is used for transfers
between third-parties, or for transfers
involving inanimate sources and/or
destinations, when the speaker feels
that the transfer is somehow
disadvantageous or at best neutral for
them.

\re
\de to please (s.o.), to be liked by (s.o.)
\oe This verb is used mostly to indicate
non-romantic attraction to people
(basically 'to like as a friend') or
animals. It can also be used with an
inanimate subject (an object, concept
or activity, including a subordinate
clause), but then it is very strong, with
connotations of 'to be fond of (doing)
sthg'.
\ue
\ee This verb refers to the mental activity
usually referred to as 'liking' in English.
However, it does so with a different
argument orientation: the subject of the
verb is the thing or person liked, while
the object is the person doing the liking.
